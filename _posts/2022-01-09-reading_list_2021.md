### ★★★★½

**_A History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia's North Asian Colony 1581-1990_ – James Forsyth**<br>
Just the book I needed to feed my obsession with Siberia and The Far East [...]

### ★★★★

**_A Swim in a Pond in the Rain: In Which Four Russians Give a Master Class on Writing, Reading, and Life_ – George Saunders**<br>
The stories are, of course, a pleasure to read, especially Tolstoy's _"Master and Man"_, Gogol's _"The Nose"_, Turgenev's _"The Singers"_ ... But what I didn't expect was just how illuminating Saunders's commentary is to each story, and how much I learned about what goes into crafting a good short story. I'm not a writer, but a lot of the exercises and approaches here apply just as well to critically reading and enjoying fiction, and I came out of this book with a deeper appreciation of Russian literature and the short story in general.

**_Flutes of Fire: Essays on California Indian Languages_ – Leanne Hinton**<br>
_(Something of a re-read – I've read part of it before for a class in undergrad, but never read it cover-to-cover before.)_
This book feels like something of a rarity – a broad-strokes look at indigenous languages of California that's accessible to the layperson while still being linguistically rigorous and not "dumbing down" the subject matter. And it's simply a delight to read, as you can feel Hinton's sense of wonder about the languages and language features that she's writing about. This is the book that originally kindled my interest in linguistics when I read part of it in an introductory college course, and reading it now brings that feeling back. The last two sections, "Language and Dominion" and "Keeping the Languages Alive", are ones that I don't think I've read before and they feel particularly important now, though it's sad to think how much has likely been lost since this book was first published in 1994.

**_Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time_ – Johanna Nichols**<br>
There's a lot going on here, even for a reader like me with only an undergraduate grasp of linguistics. Nichols (1) presents a small set of especially "stable" language features; (2) assesses these features for nearly 200 languages covering most of the world's language families and isolates, building probably the largest database of language typology of its time; (3) presents a novel way to trace the stability of each of these features over space and time; and (4) from there, develops a theory of language diversity that both suggests answers to long-standing puzzles _(Q: Why are there so many more distinct language families in the Americas than in the "Old World"? A: The typological properties common in American languages are exactly the ones that make the comparative method less viable over longer time-spans, as the necessary linguistic data "erodes" away more quickly.)_ and raises new ones _(Nichols's data suggests that the Americas were initially populated largely by people coming from the Australian/Papuan direction, which certainly isn't a mainstream theory)_. This is a truly monumental project, that easily could have ended up as multiple important books, and it is wild to see so much ambition and insight packed into a single, fairly slim, volume.

**_Bullshit Jobs: A Theory_ – David Graeber**<br>
Somewhere in the book, Graeber describes the job of a cultural anthropologist to be to dig deeply into cultural assumptions that are taken at face value (or something like that, I'm paraphrasing), and _Bullshit Jobs_ does just that. It examines a concept that doesn't even feel worthy of writing a book about ("many jobs feel boring and meaningless" is hardly news!), and uses it as a lens to examine the bureaucratization of the economy, the history of popular perception of capitalism, and some surprising holdovers from the age of feudalism that seem to reassert themselves in today's "bullshit" jobs. And unlike many such books that present series social issues without presenting much in the way of a remedy, Graeber ends with a decent argument in favor of universal basic income as at least a partial solution here.

**_Dune_ – Frank Herbert**<br>
_(Technically a re-read, but I haven't read it since I was in high school, so I'll count it.)_
Re-reading _Dune_ (for the obvious reasons) was an interesting experience because, while I remembered the overall plot outline, one thing that slipped my memory was just how _weird_ of a book _Dune_ is, and I mean that in the best possible way. Even compared to its New Wave science fiction contemporaries, _Dune_ is really its own thing, spending seemingly more time speculating about desert ecology, religion, and the spread of ideas than on, you know, the action itself, much of which ends up taking place "off-screen".

### ★★★½

**_Manhattan Beach_ – Jennifer Egan**<br>
A beautifully-written novel with a lot of passages that I really liked, that unfortunately seemed to sputter out partway through, with too much time spent following a gangster subplot that just felt like one cliché after another. Egan spent over a decade putting _Manhattan Beach_ together, and her meticulous attention to period detail is clear, but in the process the novel ends up not having the same kind of wild spark that _A Visit From the Goon Squad_ had.
_[File under Fiction / Historical.]_

**_We Should All Be Feminists_ – Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie**<br>
The author makes her point clearly and elegantly. It's a very short read, but perhaps is just the length it needs to be.
_[File under Essays.]_

**_Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy_ – Cathy O'Neil**<br>
A well-written and timely analysis of the dangers of the over-reliance on ML to do things like score résumés and process loan applications. I feel like there's not too much here that people in the ML field haven't been warning about for years, but it's important that this issue gets broader attention, and this book does a great job of clearly explaining the issue to a wide audience.
_[File under Technology / Social Aspects]_

**_The Chess Garden: Or, The Twilight Letters of Gustav Uyterhoeven_ – Brooks Hansen**<br>
This might not be my _favorite_ novel I read this year, but it is certainly one that will stick in my memory for a long time. I don't even really know how to describe it – a colorful biography of the (fictional) Dr. Uyterhoeven, interspersed with his stories of a journey through a land populated by anthropomorphic board game pieces, which in turn form allegories about ... the conflict between rationalism and "vitalism"? This is a profoundly ambitious novel that comes very close to something special. It does end up feeling tedious near the middle, and the ending was a little too overtly "spiritual" for my taste. But nonetheless, I have no regrets about opening up this book.

### ★★½

**_Bay Area Cocktails: A History of Culture, Community and Craft_ – Shanna Farrell**<br>
Farrell has certainly done her research, conducting dozens of interviews over several years to put together this book. And it's full of interesting tidbits about the various characters behind the Bay Area's cocktail renaissance. What feels missing is a discussion of just what makes the Bay Area special (if anything!) - most of the trends that the author traces in cocktail history have little to do with this particular region, and as a result the book feels aimless at times.
_[File under Food & Drink / Cocktails / History.]_

**_Reality and Other Stories_ – John Lancaster**<br>
"Old-fashioned ghost stories about technology" is a premise that I very much wanted to like, but unfortunately Lancaster fails to deliver with most of these. Most of them feel a little too clever, as though they're written by someone who wants to write "genre fiction" but is feeling just a bit too smug about it. The best story in the collection, "Reality", is also the one that is the furthest away from that overall premise.

### ★★

**_Gem of the Lost Coast: A Narrative History of Shelter Cove_ – Mario Machi**<br>
A passably-written collection of local history of the Shelter Cove area, written by an active participant in that history.
_[File under History / California / Local.]_

### ★½

**_Native California Hero's_ [sic] _of the Miwok Confederation: Teleguac, Estanislas and Yolosko_ – Guy (Redcorn) Nixon**<br>
I was hoping to read some interesting and previously undocumented bits of Miwok history taken from oral interviews conducted by the author. Unfortunately, the end result is so poorly written as to be largely unreadable. The opening chapters, on the ecological aspects of Native Californians' first interactions with settlers, raises some interesting questions but are difficult to take at face value.
