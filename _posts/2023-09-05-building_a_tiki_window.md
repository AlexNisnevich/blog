_(Thanks to Annie and Asali for all your help on this project!)_

I set out to build a Trader Sam-style "tiki window" for our home tiki bar. You know, this kind of thing, that no home tiki bar seems to be complete without – a screen behind a bamboo façade showing animated tropical imagery:

I perused [some Reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tiki/comments/ytb2fr/diy_trader_sams_window/) and saw a [brief but helpful Youtube how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0efUNJxK_c) but couldn't really find a complete step-by-step guide, so I ended up largely making things up as I went along.

Here's how I did it.

# Step 1: The Screen

"Digital picture frames" are a thing but all the ones I found online were either too small or too expensive for this project. I didn't really want to buy a brand-new monitor for this, so instead I went to the legendary [Urban Ore](https://urbanore.com/) and found a decade-old [23" Acer monitor](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/354b16c3) for $20. It was missing its power adapter, but no problem – I managed to find a [compatible adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LRZGD2M) online.

After testing that the monitor actually worked, I pried off its base and set out to build an enclosure for it.

# Step 2: The Housing

The monitor measured about 2" thick at its thickest points, so I figured I could build a reasonable enclosure out of 2x4 boards (for an nominal depth of 4", so an actual depth of 3½"), giving me enough wiggle room to fit the monitor and any other electronics I would need inside.

I cut the boards to size, double-checked that the monitor would fit (before it was too late!):

and attached them together with pocket screws and Gorilla wood glue:

Once the frame of 2x4s was assembled, I made a "lip" on the inside out of ½"-square dowels, so that the monitor wouldn't be able to slide forward once placed, and covered those dowels with some rope-shaped trim, just using wood glue for attachment throughout:

I also made a 1½"-diameter round hole at the center of one of the long sides of the frame, for running a power cord through.

Now it's time to fit the monitor inside!

The monitor is kept in place with some additional dowel pieces at the back of it (not pictured).

# Step 3: The Bamboo

I was fortunate to have some [1¾"-thick bamboo slats from Forever Bamboo](https://foreverbamboo.com/natural-bamboo-slats-1-75-x-72-x-0-25-25-pack/) lying around from another project. These slats are perfectly sized for this housing – exactly two of them fit side-by-side on each 3½"-thick edge side. On the front, the 1¾"-thick slats don't quite reach the end of the dowel lip (it's 1½"+½" thick), but still form a nice effect with the rope trim underneath.

I was a little paranoid about using a nail gun this close to the screen, so we just attached the slats the old-fashioned way, with lots of wood glue. First on the front (using a miter box for the 45° cuts):

And then the sides:

# Step 4: The Rest of the Electronics

So now that we have a monitor in an enclosure, how do we want to actually play things on it? 

I didn't really want to put an Internet-connected streaming player inside it (wanted to go a little more low-tech for this), so instead I got a [NEUMI Atom 4K digital media player](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089VXSD1H) and loaded a flash drive with videos that I obtained using `yt-dlp` and then [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) to convert to H.264. (For what it's worth, I had to test out a few different HDMI media players and the NEUMI Atom 4K was the only one that was able to handle the 8-hour-long H.264 videos that I threw at it.)

You can kind of see how the back of it all looks here:

<img class="figure" src="https://i.imgur.com/pcSwiLo.jpg" style="width: 100%" />

It's really pretty simple – all we have is the monitor itself with its (replacement) power adaptor, the HDMI player with a tiny USB stick inserted, both plugged into a power strip at the top of the box (this is mainly because I liked the aesthetics of having a single cord coming out of this thing – but I also had to bring in a 6" extension cord because otherwise I couldn't get the akwardly-shaped power brick for the HDMI player to fit within the confines of the box). 

Note that I positioned the HDMI player precisely with its IR receiver directly over the hole at the bottom of the enclosure – so that I can control it (change videos, etc) by pointing the remote at the bottom hole while it's operating.

_Oh, what's that piece of paper doing there underneath the monitor, you may ask?_ Well, one thing that I didn't really think about until it was too late is that the power button for the monitor is ... at the bottom of it. So the way that I installed it, the monitor was always resting on that button (actually, all of the buttons). Fortunately there was a little bit of wiggle room, so I elevated it just a bit with that sheet of paper – just enough so that the power button isn't being pressed constantly. And I now have a very janky mechanism for turning the monitor itself on or off – take out the piece of paper and lift and then release the monitor, hitting the power button once. (Fortunately I rarely have to do this, as I have a footswitch connected to the power strip itself that I use to control power to the monitor and media player simultaneously.)

# Step 5: Mounting

With the tiki window built, the last thing I had to worry about was mounting it. The whole thing, wood and electronics at all, only weighs something like 20–25 lbs, but I didn't want to take any chances. I installed a 1x2 cross-bar (you can see it in the photo above) and attached a [French cleat](https://www.homedepot.com/p/OOK-200-lbs-French-Cleat-Picture-Hanger-with-Wall-Dog-Mounting-Screws-1-Pack-55316/202341629) rated at 200 lbs to make sure this thing is really going nowhere.

I hung it up in our little tiki nook, and _voila!_

Coming from essentially zero woodworking experience, this was a bit of an intimidating project to try to take on, but we managed to pull it off pretty much without a hitch. It's become a centerpiece of our little tiki bar and has definitely inspired me to get more into creative DIY projects – we'll see where that goes!
