I'_ve also started subscribing to a few magazines this year - Nautilus and [Two Lines Press](http://twolinespress.com/two-lines-journal/) - and both have been incredible reads so far. I read an issue of Lapham's Quarterly (VIII.3 - "Philanthropy") that had a huge influence on me, and I wish I had the time to subscribe to it too, but it's such a dense magazine that reading it four times a year would leave no time for books 🙁
