After 2Â½ years of recording, re-recording, production, mixing, and mastering, my swamp metal band's album is finally out!

_Gator_ is an eclectic mix of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, and classic blues. I have a feeling you'll like it.

The album is available on Spotify ...

... as well as [Bandcamp](https://gatorcomingforyou.bandcamp.com/album/gator) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/gatorcomingforyou/sets/gator).

If you like what you hear, [pre-order the vinyl](https://qrates.com/projects/16558)! We're doing a very limited press of 200 copies.
