It's been about three months since [Greg]() and I released [Untrusted]() into the world, so I thought that now's as good a time as any to write something about how Untrusted came to be.

## In the Beginning ...

- hackathon
- Greg's idea
- working on the game
- winning the hackathon
- early prototype: http://alex.nisnevich.com/untr/hackathon/

## The Next Year

[see untrusted-timeline file on my desktop]

## Release

- initial spike on HN
- after an hour, dad's server couldn't handle the load
    - problem:
    - people became unable
- solutions
    - short-term solution: move to github pages ASAP
    - move music to cloudfront
    - overnight, Greg and I fixed level loading to prevent this issue from occurring again - all levels now loaded from start (except bonus levels + scripts for lvl21)

## Reactions to Untrusted

- see untrusted-mentions on my desktop
- by the numbers:
    - 350,000 plays
    - GitHub: 2000 stars, 350 forks

## What's Next for Untrusted?
