My dance-rock band <a href="http://extraextramusic.com/">Extra! Extra!</a> has just released our debut album, <i>Never Been to a Party</i>, after a year-long recording and mixing process. The album is a blend of new wave, punk, disco, and electronic rock, with influences ranging from LCD Soundsystem to the B-52s to ESG. I think you'll like it.

The album is available on Spotify ...

... as well as [Bandcamp](https://extraextramusic.bandcamp.com/album/never-been-to-a-party) and most other streaming platforms.

We will hopefully press it to vinyl next year, if there is demand for it!
