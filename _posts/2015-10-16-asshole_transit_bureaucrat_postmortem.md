## What went wrong

### Too much conceptual complexity

This is a bit of a common problem with me and Ludum Dare: it's been an issue with [It's Not Easy Being Muammar]() and, to some extent, [Asteroid Tycoon](). In this case, the complexity bit us in two ways.

On the one hand, it was hard for players to understand what was going on. The goal was already a difficult one to wrap your head around (make a transit system _less_ efficient? what does that _mean_?), but the fact that the only thing you were able to control was the order of stops in a bus route made it even worse. Add to that the fact that there were some subtle issues with the buses that prevented them from always following their prescribed routes, and players were left completely clueless.

On the other hand, it was exceptionally difficult for us to actually make the damn thing work. We ended up only being able to spend maybe 20% of our time working on gameplay because just getting the traffic simulation part working took so much time and energy.

### Poor task management

[Too much independent work with no ability to glue it together]

### Homogenous team


## What went right

### sticking through it to the end, even though it didn't look like a finished game

### best aesthetics given constraints - good looking minimalism + one high-quality track

### sense of humor, not taking the game too seriously



## What went OK

### Using Elm


## In conclusion
