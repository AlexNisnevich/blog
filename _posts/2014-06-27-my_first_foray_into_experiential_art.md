I presented "A Snack in Every Port" at [Appetite Obscure #8: Seacret](https://web.archive.org/web/20170616091447/http://www.appetiteobscure.org:80/potlucks/no-8/),
an interactive potluck.

From the description on the site:

<div class="quote">
	<h3 class="appetiteObscureTitle">A Snack in Every Port</h3>

	<img class="figure" src="/blog/images/a-snack-in-every-port.png" width="500px">

	<p>A map and a compass lie in front of you. Look for the dot that represents your ship. Place the point of the compass on the dot, and mark the shipâ€™s next location with the pencil. Where you land determines what you eat.</p>

	<p>
		Open Water: Crust of Bread &amp; Slice of Lime<br>
		Cookie Confederation: Sugar Cookie<br>
		Appetizer Archipelago: Mini Shishkabob<br>
		Cupcake Coast: Chocolate Cupcake<br>
		Sultanate of Salmon: Cracker with Salmon and Cream Cheese<br>
		Principality of Parch: Dangerous-looking Bottle of Unidentified Booze
	</p>

<p>Appetite Obscure was great fun altogether (from preparing the dish to demonstrating it to trying other dishes), and I look forward to attending more interactive potlucks in the future.</p>
